- [x] Analyze requirements for the deadline reminder and response flow
- [x] Review existing scheduler and Slack message modules (`src/scheduler/taskReminder.ts`, `src/slack/postTaskReminder.ts`, `src/ui/taskCard.ts`)
- [ ] Implement logic to trigger reminders 2 hours before task deadlines
- [ ] Create Slack direct message card with task info and two buttons: "Completed" and "Not Completed"
- [ ] Implement Slack interaction handlers for both responses
- [ ] On "Completed" click: update task status in the database
- [ ] On "Not Completed" click: prompt user for reason and store response in the database
- [ ] Ensure database schema supports storing completion status and explanation
- [ ] Test the full flow end-to-end (scheduler → Slack message → user response → DB update)
- [ ] Verify results and handle edge cases (e.g., missing assignee, past deadlines)
